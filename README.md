# Student Record Management System (SRMS)

This is a small console-based project written in C to manage student records.
It uses simple file handling and a menu-driven approach.

The program allows an admin to add student details and view all records.
Pass or fail is decided automatically based on marks.
To make it feel more like real software, basic terminal simulations like loading
and progress indicators are included.

## How to run
```bash
gcc code.c -o SRMS
./SRMS
